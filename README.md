# **0xhellofriend**
### *a mr. robot rewatch + deep dive project*

welcome, friend.

this repository contains the official notes, analysis, episode breakdowns, and research for the **0xhellofriend podcast** — a mr. robot rewatch hosted by **mehul** and **joaquin**.

this repo includes:

- episode notes
- symbolism and theme breakdowns
- tech verification (what’s real vs fiction)
- acting & character insights
- real-world hack references
- conspiracy threads explored in the show
- drafts of podcast segments and scripts
- raw ideas, thoughts, and riff notes

as the show continues, this repo becomes a living archive — part documentation, part digital journal, part companion guide.


our goal is to **reverse-engineer** the show from two complementary perspectives:

---

## 🖥️ engineer’s eye
- tech realism
- hacking accuracy
- osint parallels
- cybersecurity breakdowns
- digital psychology
- “real or hollywood hack?” analysis

## 🎭 actor’s eye
- performance choices
- character motivations
- directing decisions
- themes & symbolism
- cinematic language
- story structure & pacing

each episode gets a focused, structured breakdown meant to feel like a cross between a production dossier and a hacker’s field notes.
